# Jupyter Notebook

# What you will learn 
In this guide you'll learn how to use the Jupyter Notebook and the integrated JupyterLab IDE. Jupyter is a free and open-source web application (in the form of a Python module) that allows you to create and share documents that contain code, equations, text and images incorporated.

It's widely used in the Data Science process, in order to explore data, clean them, and experiment problem solutions.

### Why Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are a way of embedding ready-to-execute python code with markdown documentation, images, and other such things, all in one file, as well as a program for presenting and running them. 

They're nice if you want to demonstrate a short script to another person, particularly in a data science context, because of some built-in plotting niceties and the fact that you can run cells of code individually. 

They are [widely used in Data Science](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1), because as we know the Data Science Process is an experimental and incremental process.

There are several reasons to choose Jupyter Notebook for the first phases of the Data Science process (e.g. data exploration, data cleaning):

- it's easy to write more than one line of the code before running. You do not need an editor on the side, crafting functions and then copying to the shell

- results presentation is richer than console. It supports graphs, images, tables. Effectively anything that can be represented by html, css and js

- if you make a mistake, you can trivially rerun that "cell" (chunk of code, nothing else) once you fix the mistake

- you can install it on some more powerful machine and interact with it in your browser, so works for you if you're not super friendly with terminal stuff

- you can export run results as html page. a run of a notebook is effectively a static thing. notebook consists of code + results of running the code.

_Curiosity:_ Project Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python and R, and also a homage to Galileo's notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter.
