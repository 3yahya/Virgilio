### Motivation




### Ask Questions
A rule of thumb rule to learn fast and effectively is to ask questions and read other's questions and answers.

Join communities of people interested in the topic (e.g. Reddit): here you can find discussions, search by keywords (e.g. "matrix multiplication"), and ask questions, with experts who will answer and help you.

Some _tips_ regarding questions:

- Try to form specific, well-written questions, to minimize the time used by the respondent.
- Do not ask a question whose answer is found with a quick search on google.
- If the questions are too general or show laziness they'll likely remain unanswered...

Some subreddits you can subscribe to are:

- [r/LearnMath](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/)


Two other good places to post (well structured) questions are:

- [HackerNews](http://hn.premii.com/)
- [Quora](https://www.quora.com/)
