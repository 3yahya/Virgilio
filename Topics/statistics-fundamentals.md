# Statistics Fundamentals

# What you will learn 

In this guide, you'll learn what is the fundamental statistical knowledge you need to have in order
to build insightful Data Science projects and build machine learning systems upon them.

You'll also learn that not so much is needed to start to apply yourself to real-world data problems!

### Motivation
The field of statistics is the **science of learning from data**.

Statistics is a crucial process behind how we make discoveries in science, make decisions based on data, and make predictions. 

Statistical knowledge helps you use the proper methods to collect the data, employ the correct analyses, and effectively present the results. 

Every fancy term you read related to the field of Data Science, or the even more misunderstood Artificial Intelligence, _is nothing more than statistical models trained with some mathematical algorithms_.

That's why **to learn the basics of statistics is fundamental** in order to tackle real-worlds Data Science problems and build powerful predictive models upon them.

The two macro-topics necessary to study the data are the **descriptive statistics** and the **theory of probability**.

### Descriptive Statistics

[Descriptive statistics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp) aim to analyse and summarise the data collected in an experiment. 

The set of methods and techniques used in descriptive statistics makes it possible to express the information contained in a set of data by means of graphs and particular numerical indicators.

Moreover, with the techniques of investigation of descriptive statistics it is possible to verify the adaptation of the experimental data to an assigned theoretical model, as well as to carry out comparative analyses between data sets.

Descriptive statistics are widely used in economics, demography, medicine, and in all natural sciences.

First of all watch these these videos, they are truly inspirational:

To understand the concepts of descriptive statistics, the book Virgilio recommends is the following:

[**Statistics in Plain English**](http://www.pindex.com/uploads/post_docs/statistics%20in%20plain%20english%20(3rd,%202010)(PINDEX-DOC-6952).pdf) - [Timothy C. Urdan](https://www.amazon.com/Timothy-C.-Urdan/e/B001JP8H9Q%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share)

This book is fantastic because it focuses more on **the reason behind the concepts** concepts rather than on formulas or calculations, which are easily found elsewhere. 

**The book is mandatory for a full understanding of descriptive statistics** (it is certainly not the only book of statistics out there, but it is the best in terms of clarity of explanation and completeness of the basic concepts.).

Once finished, you can choose whether to go deeper with a more technical manual, like the following:

[**Elements of Statistics**](https://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=18263&printable=1)

This book deals in more depth with the various topics, but to start doing small experiments in Data Science is not necessary to address it immediately. 

**Keep it as a reference!**

### Probability Theory
### Ask Questions
A rule of thumb rule to learn fast and effectively is to ask questions and read other's questions and answers.

Join communities of people interested in the topic (e.g. Reddit): here you can find discussions, search by keywords (e.g. "matrix multiplication"), and ask questions, with experts who will answer and help you.

Some _tips_ regarding questions:

- Try to form specific, well-written questions, to minimize the time used by the respondent.
- Do not ask a question whose answer is found with a quick search on google.
- If the questions are too general or show laziness they'll likely remain unanswered...

Some subreddits you can subscribe to are:

- [r/LearnMath](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/)


Two other good places to post (well structured) questions are:

- [HackerNews](http://hn.premii.com/)
- [Quora](https://www.quora.com/)
