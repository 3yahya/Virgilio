# Statistics Fundamentals

# What you will learn 

In this guide, you'll learn what is the fundamental statistical knowledge you need to have in order
to build insightful Data Science projects and build machine learning systems upon them.

You'll also learn that not so much is needed to start to apply yourself to real-world data problems!

Let's dive right in!
 
### Motivation
The field of statistics is the **science of learning from data**.

Statistics is a crucial process behind how we make discoveries in science, make decisions based on data, and make predictions. 

Statistical knowledge helps you use the proper methods to collect the data, employ the correct analyses, and effectively present the results. 

Every fancy term you read related to the field of Data Science, or the even more misunderstood Artificial Intelligence, _is nothing more than statistical models trained with some mathematical algorithms_.

That's why **to learn the basics of statistics is fundamental** in order to tackel real-worlds Data Science problems and build powerful predictive models upon them.

### Descriptive Statistical Reasoning
### Probability Theory

### Ask Questions
A rule of thumb rule to learn fast and effectively is to ask questions and read other's questions and answers.

Join communities of people interested in the topic (e.g. Reddit): here you can find discussions, search by keywords (e.g. "matrix multiplication"), and ask questions, with experts who will answer and help you.

Some _tips_ regarding questions:

- Try to form specific, well-written questions, to minimize the time used by the respondent.
- Do not ask a question whose answer is found with a quick search on google.
- If the questions are too general or show laziness they'll likely remain unanswered...

Some subreddits you can subscribe to are:

- [r/LearnMath](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/)


Two other good places to post (well structured) questions are:

- [HackerNews](http://hn.premii.com/)
- [Quora](https://www.quora.com/)
