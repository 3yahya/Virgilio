# Math Fundamentals

# What you will learn 
In this guide, you'll learn what is the fundamental mathematical knowledge you need to have in order
to build insightful Data Science projects and build machine learning systems upon them.

You'll also learn that not so much is needed to start to apply yourself to real-world data problems!

## Prerequisites
The previous Paradiso guides.

### Why do you need to learn some math

Before anything else, watch [**this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIbjHIGMjQM
) awesome Ted Talk :-)

The entire field of data science is based on mathematics and statistics.

This phrase shouldn't frighten you, though, because as you'll find out, you probably have much of the knowledge you need to start experimenting!

In this guide we'll see what specific mathematical knowledge you need, and if you've done a second degree school (you know matrices and derivatives, for example), you probably just need to refresh yourself on the things you already know, and go deeper into those things you may not have seen at school. 

In general, if you have a degree in a scientific subject (engineering, computer science, physics, etc.), it will probably be just a review, as it will be the Calculation courses that are suggested during this guide.

Whatever your starting level, however, it is still recommended to go through all the resources organized here, to make sure you do not have "holes in knowledge".

### Calculus

The first macro-topic we'll tackle is [Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus).

It would be impossible to list how many Machine Learning system properties are based on its rules, like many of the scientific fields!

The process of training an ML model you'll find that it's nothing more than some Calculus rules applied to statistical models! 

Luckily you can take advantage of the great free courses offered by the professors of the [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/), through the index page[MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm).

The course we suggest in particular is the following:

[**Single Variable Calculus**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/)

There are both the video lessons and the notes of the course.

Once you've taken the full course, watch this awesome playlist from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw):

[**The Essence of Calculus**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

Thanks to these two resources, you should be able to understand most of the mathematical reasons that underpin today's Machine Learning systems and build them to develop powerful Data Science projects.

#### Check your knowledge

Test your knowledge with [**these**](http://webmath2.unito.it/paginepersonali/cordero/English/derivatives.pdf) exercises.

Anyway you can find a ton of them online, and remember, that _the more you make exercise, the better!_

### Linear Algebra

The second macro-topic on which Machine Learning systems are based is [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra).

You probably already tasted these topics in high school, but certainly not with the right degree of depth.

So, how do you excellently learn linear algebra?

Virgilio was born to spread knowledge and content, and there are many ways to do it: through text, audio, video... 

But the absolute best way (in terms of effectiveness and speed of understanding) is the visual way!

Our brain uses most of its computing power to process visual data, because when we evolved in the African Savannah the most important thing to do was to be able to see a predator and escape!

It is therefore not surprising that the visual interaction of concepts installs them deep into our minds, almost experientially, rather than conceptually!

Imagine, for example, thinking about the formula of the diagonal of a square... reading it is a very abstract thing, but if we imagine in a _visual_ way the graphical reason that leads to the formula, it will make much more sense!

Now, fortunately, there are incredibly skilled and intelligent people in the world, and some of them have created this:

[**Immersive math - Linear Algebra**](http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html)

Once you click on the link and start exploring this interactive book, you won't believe your eyes for the clarity and effectiveness with which the concepts are explained. 

This book currently contains so much information and so well done that it deserves a front-row seat in Virgilio!

Take your time, explore the book, fall in love with those interactive explanations!

Going through this would be sufficient to get all the remaining knowledge you need from a mathematical perspective, to understand most of the papers and code out there!

Note:
Chapter 6 is about Matrix Algebra, and it's indeed very good (like the rest of the book), but we're very proud of [**_Virgilio's official Matrix Algebra guide_**](https://github.com/virgili0/Virgilio/blob/master/NewToDataScience/MatrixAlgebra.ipynb), and we suggest you to use both resources! 

Moreover, Virgilio's guide to Matrix Algebra is an interactive Jupyter Notebook, with exercises included! 

#### Check your knowledge

Test your knowledge with [**these**](https://web.pdx.edu/~erdman/LINALG/Linalg_pdf.pdf) exercises.

Anyway you can find a ton of them online, and remember, that _the more you make exercise, the better!_

### Conclusions
We concluded that _x_, _y_ and _z_.
