# Starting a Data Project

# What you will learn 
In this guide you'll learn to prepare yourself to start the project. 

This will consist of building the project structure, looking for sources that can help you solve the problem, build good documentation and more!


## Prerequisites
All the previous Purgatorio guides.

## Time to complete
10 minutes.

### Hunting for Information
A vital phase when starting a project is to search for information that can help you. These can be of any kind:
- Tutorials
- Documentation
- Existing projects
- Research Papers
- ...

This guide will not teach you how to use [Google](https://www.google.com/), hopefully you will already know if you are reading these lines :-).
But there are a few tips that can come in handy when you start "amassing" knowledge that will then come in handy.

#### Understand what you're looking for
The first thing to do when dealing with a new problem is to make sure you're looking for the right things. Are you sure the problem is called that for example? Image segmentation is different from image classification! This Google guide](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/problem-framing/cases) can help you be sure of the name of your problem.

This may seem trivial, but many useful resources are not found because the correct keywords are not typed into the search engine.

#### Don't re-invent the wheel
Are you sure that someone hasn't already solved your own problem? In that case, if you needed it to solve a real problem you'd already have the dish ready, while if you're doing it to learn you have a base from which to start! Also, observing the code of others is very effective for learning.
In the latter case it is still advisable to try to re-implement the solution.

To look if someone has solved your same problem the first place to look is definitely [Github](https://github.com/), the platform where every developer puts Open Source code. 
Another interesting place can be [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the site of the Data Science challenges, where thousands of practitioners and experts challenge each other on real problems, and whose works are available in the form of Notebooks.

Let's suppose for example that I want to solve a problem related to time series: I can type on Kaggle "analysis of time series" and I will probably find dozens of Notebooks that show how to solve a similar problem, and from which you can observe the approach. What a great source of inspiration!

Also check out [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub), [ModelZoo](https://modelzoo.co/) and [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/). These three platforms are full of pre-trained models that can come in handy, or even solve your problem already! :) 

#### Find communities
Join communities of people interested in the topic (e.g. [Reddit](www.reddit.com)): here you can find discussions, search by keywords (e.g. "time series analysis"), and ask questions, with experts who will answer and help you. 

Try to form specific, well-written questions, so as to minimize the time used by the respondent. For example, the question "how do I analyze a time series?" is too general, and a short Google search is all it takes to get the answer. 

Instead, a question like "to analyze a time series and train a model that preaches 2 steps forward in the future, is it better to approach X or approach Y?".

If the questions are too general or show laziness it is very likely that they remain unanswered...
