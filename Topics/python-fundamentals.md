Let's dive right in!
 
### Why Programming
### Why Python

According to Sun Tzu:
> If you don't know Python, learn it yesterday!

There are hundreds of programming languages, mature as C and C++, or recent as Ruby, C# or Lua, or even corporate giants like Java. 

Choosing a programming language to learn is difficult. 

There is no language that is the right answer to all possible problems, but Python is a good choice in many cases and is also 
well positioned for those who learn to program. 

Python is used by hundreds of thousands of programmers around the 
world and their numbers are growing all the time.

There are many reasons for this success.

- Python works everywhere, whether Windows, Linux/UNIX, Mac or other, from supercomputers to mobile phones. 

- It allows you to develop small applications and fast prototypes, but is structured for creating large programs.

- It is equipped with an easy to use graphical user interface, libraries for web programming. Best of all, it's free.

Why do you need to learn Python? 

Python is simple to understand, is simple to read, is powerful and flexible, can help you in everyday tasks 
(even if you're not a programmer!) and automatize a lot of boring stuff.

Moreover, is the core Data Science tool, and most of the frameworks we'll need in the next guides
are written in Python or have rich Python wrappers.

**Note:** 

In many Internet guides you will find the programming language [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) recommended for Data Science.

R is a purely statistical programming language (not general purpose / scripting like Python).

Now, the opinion shared by Virgilio's collaborators is as follows:

**IF**:

- you are a beginner in programming
- You're a beginner in data science.

**THEN**:

It makes no sense to learn two programming languages at the same time. 

It's a waste of time and energy, and it just creates confusion. 

Not to mention that while a Python is the undisputed king of scientific computing in general, and it is not acceptable that a Data Scientist does not know it, R is not as widespread and used and, even remotely, does not have the support that Python has and its amount of useful libraries.

What does this mean? that R is useless? certainly not! Indeed, it is recognized that its data visualization and formatting capabilities are useful and powerful... But really, if you're starting your path in Data Science today, start with Python!

Are you convinced now?

### Computer Science Fundamentals
### Learn Python



This guide will take you _from zero coding knowledge_ to a solid Python skill and a complete awareness of the most important concepts in programming. 

After this path, you'll be prepared to tackle the more advanced topics! 

I'm not going to re-invent the wheel so, for our purposes, [**THIS**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) free book is the perfect track to follow. You can [buy](https://nostarch.com/automatestuff) it too.

In this guide, the first chapters of the book are addressed. After reading a chapter, do at least 15-20 progressive exercises, trying to look for alternative solutions.

We're gonna install Python (the interpreter of the code you will write) and Pycharm (a development environment that will simplify your coding life).

[Here](http://keyseronline.net/TGC/PythonInstallInstructions.pdf) you have an in-depth guide on how to install Python and Pycharm on every operating system.
