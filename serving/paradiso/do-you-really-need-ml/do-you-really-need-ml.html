You can refer to <a href="/Virgilio/serving/paradiso/do-you-really-need-ml/do_you_need_ml.html">this previous guide</a> for guidelines on how to compare responses and understand the feasibility of projects.
Of course, to fully evaluate the feasibility of a project you need experience and knowledge of the domain, but you can rest assured that if one of the three elements is missing, it is likely that what is being proposed is pure distillate of hype.</p> <p>So we understand how justified hype is, in the sense that Deep Learning opens up incredible possibilities and without previous examples, but it is also a double-edged weapon, which can damage the very economy of technology because it does not meet the (too high) expectations.</p> <h4 id="evaluate-opportunities"><a href="#evaluate-opportunities" class="header-anchor">#</a> Evaluate Opportunities</h4> <p>The previous premise does not take away the fact that if you have data, know-how and computational power, it is <em>probable</em> that Deep Learning can offer you incredible possibilities.</p> <p>How can you find out if the data you have hides hidden pearls? in general you can think that, having the right amount of data (for example, rows of a database), you can use Machine Learning methods to predict the value (continuous) or the class (discrete) associated with a row. In other words, you can try to predict the value of a column!</p> <p>Imagine the following (simplified) situation:</p> <p>We have an e-commerce database, which contains for each line the record of purchase of a product.
Some columns are: &quot;name&quot;, &quot;color&quot;, &quot;price&quot;, &quot;price range&quot;.
The column &quot;price range&quot; contains a label that identifies if an item has a low price or high, and is provided by the company that produces the product (we have not assigned it).</p> <p>Every now and then, however, the company that supplies the products is careless and forgets to assign a price range to the object.</p> <p>How can we solve this problem?</p> <p>The problem consists in a binary classification task that takes as input the price of the object (some features, such as color, do not affect the price in this case) and returns in output the label of the price range (&quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;).</p> <ul><li>We can try to apply a Deep Learning technique</li> <li>We can try to apply a more general Machine Learning technique</li> <li>We can use a heuristics program that's been created specifically for that.</li></ul> <p>Let's analyze the various possibilities:</p> <p>First of all, it must be said that the simplest solution would perhaps be to change supplier 😃
Apart from this joke not funny, let's start from the case of application of Deep Learning, then a &quot;prmitive&quot; Machine Learning linear model, and then the heuristic.</p> <p>You could think of developing a neural network that takes in input all the features and returns in output the value of the price range. But it would probably be an overkill! In fact, as we know, the data must be cleaned, prepared to be inserted into the network, the network must be trained and adjusted until it reaches satisfactory evaluation metrics! In addition, if tomorrow the requirements of the forecast change (for example because you add a new label) all this process would be to be done again, and a new network would be to be trained.</p> <p>Deep learning is an extremely powerful tool, and for this reason you should avoid using it for tasks that are too simple (overengineering is never good).</p> <p>This problem can be solved much more simply with a simple Machine Learning generic linear model that maps the input to the output without the need to introduce &quot;non-linearity&quot; (main advantage of neural networks). A linear classifier can easily solve the problem, and would probably get even better performance (for reasons that are beyond the scope of this guide, such as lower variance).</p> <p>Indeed, this problem is so simple that the use of heuristic rules such as &quot;if... then...&quot; could solve it. In fact we could notice that simply all the objects are a certain N value are classified as &quot;cheap&quot; and those above that N as &quot;very expensive&quot;. This simple heuristics, expressed with two lines of code in any programming language, solves the problem in the same way.</p> <p>This reasoning exercise does not want to &quot;put Deep Learning and Machine Learning in a bad light&quot; at all, on the contrary!</p> <p>But it must be used to understand that they are not always the simplest solution, and sometimes they can be a useless effort (especially in the absence of data, they are worth little).</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/when-not-to-use-neural-networks-89fb50622429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> article has good considerations about this.</p> <p>So always ask yourself the following question: is my problem quite complex and I have enough data to make useful machine learning techniques or even deep learning?</p> <h4 id="the-charming-salesman"><a href="#the-charming-salesman" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Charming Salesman</h4> <p>Information technology like any other industry is first and foremost a business.</p> <p>The techniques and tools of ML and DL are no exception, and their primary task is to solve business problems.
