## Buy This Book
Virgilio **strongly recommend** you to buy this phenomenal book: [**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow**](https://www.amazon.it/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-learn-Tensorflow/dp/1492032646/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=58345655971&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6IHwBRCJARIsALNjViW4Jw8kyO8xEPOiBSRLof5hccJ-xVOtW0PHCUOSBszyNIJZZlMfNYoaAorMEALw_wcB&hvadid=255175924799&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1008144&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=e&hvrand=214277416768465994&hvtargid=aud-834369398293%3Akwd-295090772533&hydadcr=18606_1822710&keywords=hands+on+machine+learning&qid=1577095736&sr=8-1). 

The book has inspired the birth of Virgilio and has driven most of the organization and hierarchy of the content listed below.

**Be sure to but the 2nd edition of the book, which comes with TensorFlow 2.0 and many of the chapters updated.**

Apart from this, **everything** listed here is open source and free, from world-renowned universities and open source associations, in pure Virgilio's spirit. 

Note: _if you think about the price of the book is high, be okay with that, but remember that you won't find an higher quality hands-on book on Machine and Deep Learning. Don't hesitate, the book is definitely worth its price._  

It is necessary to avoid confusion when we learn something new, especially when the topic is as wide and complex as Machine Learning. When possible, we've tried to create this guide and the following ones _preferring content from the same author or context_.

## The Machine Learning Landscape
First things first! 

Directly from the book cited earlier, this is the most concise and illuminating overview of **what is** and **when you need** machine learning. Let's stop using buzzwords!

Check it here: [**The Machine Learning Landscape**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/ch01.html).

Also check this: [A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/).

## End-to-End Machine Learning project
Virgilio wants you to actually _feel_ what a complete Data Science project would be, along with model creation and selection. You

For a first taste, go through [this](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions) Kaggle notebook, which has a classical example of an ML task. 

**The goal is to try to predict if a Titanic passenger would have been most likely to survive or not.**

This is commonly considered the "Hello World" problem for new Machine Learning practitioners.

Many things will be unclear for now, but don't worry, they will all be explained comprehensively later. It is nice to get the picture of the "applied" project, going through the classical steps of applied Machine Learning (problem framing, data exploration, question formulation...). 

The notebook is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the go-to platform for ML and general Data Science projects, which provides a lot of free datasets and offers interesting challenges and ML model experiments.

Remember: Read the notebook and try to understand the big picture of the process. Some details, functions and code will be clearer later.

## Machine Learning Full Course
Now that you've been exposed to your first machine learning end-to-end project, you may be start wondering _how do you choose an algorithm to try on your data_, and what is the learning theory behind them. 

The best thing you can do now is to take a full course on Machine Learning theory. 

There are plenty of those out there, but the most classical and complete course is probably the most famous one too.

Plan some weeks of study and prepare to follow: 

[**Machine Learning Course from Andrew NG**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

This course would take you through the basics of Machine Learning algorithms, plus the math theory behind the training process. Concepts like Overfitting, Regularization, and Loss Functions are explained in-depth.

The course has a part on Deep Learning, so you're not obliged to take them (even if it's recommended). 

In the next guide, "Deep Learning", we'll give you specific courses about it.

The course has homeworks to do (higly recommended), but unluckily these assignements are thought with the Octave programming language in mind, which is kind of out-dated and limited, if compared to Python. 

But don't be scared! 

Awesome peole out there re-created the course assignements in Python, through Jupyter notebooks!

Check them here: 

[**Coursera Machine Learning by Andrew Ng - Python Programming Assignments**](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)

Thanks to this course and the exercises you shoud grasp most of the basics concept behind Machine Learning theory and the process of training models. 

In the next sections of this guide we'll see some criteria on how to choose the algorithms to deepen you knowledge about. 

In fact, it's nearly impossible to know all the Machine Learning algorithms along with their versions, and many more algorithms are being developed every months!

Nevertheless, there are _some algorithms_ which are the foundation of statistical learning theory, so you want to have them clear in mind. 

For example, these algorithms are the ones a recruiter can ask you about!
